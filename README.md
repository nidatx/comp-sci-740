# Revisiting the Self Similar Nature of Web Traffic with Modern Browsers and Web pages
To be able to make important decisions about the design of the Internet, it is important to always understand the behavior of network traffic. 
While the self-similar nature of Web traffic is well-established and well-studied, it is still interesting to observe network traffic in light of changes in
the landscape of the Internet. The complexity of web pages and the strategies employed by web browsers are different now. Our project simulates users browsing popular
websites, capture HTTPS traffic and analyze how factors like prefetching, and local caching impact the self-similarity
of web traffic in the context of modern browsers and webpages.
